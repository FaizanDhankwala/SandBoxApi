# Device API Practice Project

This Java project simulates a simple **device management system** with API-like classes. It is designed for **learning object-oriented programming (OOP), getters/setters, constructors, method overriding, and simple service layers**.  

It mimics patterns often used in **Device Services APIs** in larger systems, letting you practice **creating, fetching, updating, and managing objects** in a structured way.

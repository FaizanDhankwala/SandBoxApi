# Device API Practice Project

This is a small Java project created to practice **working with classes, objects, constructors, getters/setters, and simple API-like service classes**. It simulates basic operations on devices using a `DeviceRegistry` API, similar to what you might encounter in a larger system like Device Services.

## Project Overview

This project simulates a device management system with basic operations:

- Creating and storing devices (`Device` class)  
- Retrieving device information  
- Updating device status  
- Listing all devices  

It also demonstrates **object-oriented programming principles**:

- Constructors  
- Getters and setters  
- Field encapsulation  
- Method overriding  
- Using Maps to store and retrieve objects
